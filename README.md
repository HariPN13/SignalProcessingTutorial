# SignalProcessingTutorial
This is a tutorial I designed as a TA for CAMP (Computational Approaches to Memory and Plasticity).

It is an ipython notebook. To use it, you will need to install jupyter notebook and ipywidgets.
You could also install a plugin to hide code cells to make the tutorial look nicer.
